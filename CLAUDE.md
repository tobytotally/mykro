# Instructions for Claude

## Important Rules

1. **DO NOT ask for permission to proceed** - Take action immediately when given a task. Do not ask questions like "Should I proceed?", "Would you like me to...", or "Shall I...". Just do what has been asked.

2. **Be proactive** - When given a task, complete it fully without stopping to ask for confirmation at each step.

3. **Only ask questions when truly necessary** - Only ask for clarification if:
   - Critical information is missing that prevents task completion
   - Multiple interpretations exist and the wrong choice would cause issues
   - The user explicitly asks you to confirm something

## Example Behaviors

### ❌ Don't do this:
- "Would you like me to create this file?"
- "Should I proceed with running the tests?"
- "Shall I fix these errors for you?"

### ✅ Do this instead:
- Create the file immediately when asked
- Run the tests and show results
- Fix errors and report what was fixed
